# SODA-BENCHMARKS

Contains scripts and code to benchmark SODA tools in different scenarios.


# How to use?

We depend on docker and pre-generated [docker image](.devcontainer/Dockerfile#1)
to run the benchmarks. We recomend using vscode devcontainers to orchestrate the
benchmarks.

To use devcontainers, follow the steps below:

1. Install Visual Studio Code: If you haven't already, download and install Visual Studio Code from here.
2. Install the Remote - Containers extension: Open Visual Studio Code and install the "Remote - Containers" extension from the Extensions view.
3. Open the folder in devcontainer: Run the command (Ctrl+Shift+X or Cmd+Shift+X on macOS), search for "Remote - Containers".
4. Navigate to relevant folder, check README.md for instructions to execute the benchmarks.
